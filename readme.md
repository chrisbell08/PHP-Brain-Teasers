#PHP Brain Teasers

The best way to improve you coding ability is to tackle new problems. Experience is king and you will not become good at anything without experience. To imporove my own PHP coding I wanted to work on some fun coding challenges that are different from the everyday challenges you would get in a production environment. I thought it would be fun to put it up on GitHub.

## Rules
All Brain Teasers need to follow some simple rules.
-1. Inputs can only be strings or arrays and must be able to input from a form.
-2. Outputs must be of type string, int or bool
-3. The solution should be achievable in a "Reasonable" amount of code, no more than 50 lines.
